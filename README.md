👋 Hi, I’m **Ikhlass Rohni**
💻 I’m a computer science student who actually *enjoys* debugging (most days 😄).
👀 I’m interested in programming, cybersecurity, and anything that makes my brain say “aha!”.
🌱 I’m currently learning **C**, Linux basics, and slowly building my first real projects.
💞️ I love collaborating on fun and educational projects — especially ones that include UI/UX or creative problem-solving.
📫 How to reach me: bi.rohni@ensta.edu.dz
⚡Fun fact: My code works perfectly… until I show it to someone. Then it immediately decides to embarrass me 😭🔥
